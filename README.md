# Xetor-DLL-Manager
Hello, this project is French but here I am speaking English. This project involves adding a new use for an archive. The XDLLs will be managed by Xetor DLL Manager, made in Python, just to make the modifications in the registry. You will have at your disposal a .reg file that will do everything for you.
